1. Everything is case sensitive in python:
All names in python are case sensitive: variable names, function names, class names, module names, exception name.

2. Doc String resources
  1. [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/): Docstring Conventions explains what distinguishes a good
docstring from a great docstring .
  2. [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/controlflow.html#documentation-strings): Documentation Strings also touches on the subject.
  3. [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/): Style Guide for Python Code discusses good indentation style.
  4. [Python Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3.1/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types) explains what it means to say that everything  in Python is an object, because some people are pedants and like to discuss that sort of thing at great length.


3. Python data types :
  1. Booleans are either True or False .
  2. Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.
  3. Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an HTML document.
  4. Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a JPEG image file.
  5. Lists are ordered sequences of values.
  6. Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values.
  7. Sets are unordered bags of values.
  8. Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs.
